Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.",

The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System.",
